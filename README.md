# Introduction to git and GitHub webinar 


## Ideas for content:

- Intro
	- Why version control is important, why should you learn git and GitHub?
		- expected skill to have if in a role which requires coding
	- There's many different version control tools out there, git is just one of them that is widely used
	- Difference between git and GitHub

- Slides on [basic git commands](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git#basic-git-commands) with nice visualisations to explain concepts such as origin and remote/push and pull, branching, pull requests, etc.

- Maybe highlight useful GUI tools to use with git? eg. RStudio has a nice in-built feature... GitHub dekstop? VSCode?

- A few slides each on how we both use git day-to-day, highlight tips and tricks we both find useful? Or story/experience of using git?

- Maybe a bit too advanced... highlighting some other useful features of GitHub - eg. GitHub actions, deploying a website with GitHub pages?
